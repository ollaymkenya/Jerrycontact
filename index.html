                While I can provide valuable content, I am usually
                not available for skype meetings, Long messages and tons of emails. Unless something is very urgent, I
                will usually try to reply to emails 12 hours max after you have sent one. For urgent assignments, I will
                usually reply in about 1 hour from the time I receive the email. I consider urgent assignments to be
                those with a deadline of fewer than 24 hours. There are some I am still not able to help you with, such
                as, “do my 25 pages in 3 hours, and I will pay you $10,000. That’s a lie. I don’t know/believe anybody
                can meet that deadline. The best time to contact me would be between (0:00-0800 EST) New York time. Fill
                the form. Please address it as urgent, on the subject and get very specific on the direct help you would
                like me to provide. You could, for example, write, “Urgent, 10-page essay due in 8 hours.” Let me know
                if you can help me. If you don’t hear from me in about 30 minutes after sending the email, consider it
                not available.
